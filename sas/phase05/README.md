# Salamander README

This is a basic PHP project that connects to a MySQL database using credentials stored in a secure, non-tracked file.

In order for this program to work, you will need to fill out the **private/credentials.php** file with your database credentials.

You will also need to download the **salamanders.sql** file and run the code to create the database. I have purposely left out the user creation.
